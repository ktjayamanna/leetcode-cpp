# Stack Welcome
# Introduction to stack data structure

"""
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
Welcome to the Stack section!

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Think of it like a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top.

Key Stack Operations:
- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack
- Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack
- Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
- Size: Get the number of elements in the stack

Common Use Cases:
- Function call management (call stack)
- Undo operations in applications
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
- Backtracking algorithms
- Browser history navigation


EXAMPLES:
================================================================================
Basic stack operations:
stack = []
stack.append(1)    # push 1
stack.append(2)    # push 2
stack.append(3)    # push 3
# stack is now [1, 2, 3] with 3 at the top

top = stack.pop()  # returns 3, stack is now [1, 2]
peek = stack[-1]   # returns 2 without removing it


CONSTRAINTS:
================================================================================
Stack Properties:
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) access pattern
- Operations are performed at one end (top)
- Efficient O(1) push and pop operations
- Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists

# Has Path - Graph Problem
# Determine if there is a path between two nodes in a graph

"""
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
Write a function, has_path, that takes in a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a directed acyclic graph and two nodes (src, dst). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a directed path between the source and destination nodes.

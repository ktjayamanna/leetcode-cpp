# Rare Routing - Graph Problem
# Find routing paths in a rare or sparse graph

"""
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
Write a function, rare_routing, that takes in a number of cities (n) and a list of tuples where each tuple represents a direct road that connects a pair of cities. 
The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a unique route for every pair of cities. A route is a sequence of roads that does not visit a city more than once.

Cities will be numbered 0 to n - 1.

You can assume that all roads are two-way roads. This means if there is a road between A and B, then you can use that road to go from A to B or go from B to A.

EXAMPLES:
================================================================================
For example, given these roads:

0 --- 1
| \
|  \
|   \
2    3

There is a unique route for between every pair of cities.
So the answer is True.


For example, given these roads:

0 --- 1
| \
|  \
|   \
2 -- 3

There are two routes that can be used to travel from city 1 to city 2:
- first route:  1, 0, 2
- second route: 1, 0, 3, 2 
The answer is False, because routes should be unique.


COMPLEXITY:
================================================================================
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n^2)

"""

# SOLUTION:
# ================================================================================
def rare_routing(n, roads):
  graph = make_graph(n, roads)
  visited = set()
  valid = validate(graph, 0, visited, None)
  return valid and len(visited) == n


def validate(graph, node, visited, last_node):
  if node in visited:
    return False
  
  visited.add(node)
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
    if neighbor != last_node and not validate(graph, neighbor, visited, node):
      return False
    
  return True

def make_graph(n, roads):
  graph = {}
  
  for city in range(n):
    graph[city] = []
    
  for road in roads:
    a, b = road
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)
    
  return graph

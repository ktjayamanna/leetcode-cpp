# Code Workspace Tour
# Development environment setup and best practices

"""
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
This lesson introduces the coding environment and best practices for
working through data structures and algorithms problems.

Workspace Setup:
- Choose a comfortable code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Set up proper syntax highlighting
- Configure debugging tools
- Install useful extensions/plugins

Coding Best Practices:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your solutions thoroughly
- Use proper indentation and formatting


EXAMPLES:
================================================================================
File Organization:
- Group related problems together
- Use descriptive file names
- Include problem descriptions
- Add time/space complexity notes
- Keep test cases with solutions

Debugging Strategies:
- Use print statements for tracing
- Step through code with debugger
- Test with edge cases
- Verify assumptions with assertions


CONSTRAINTS:
================================================================================
Setup Requirements:
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Debugging capabilities
- Version control (Git)
- Testing framework

// How to Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
// Introduction to learning DSA effectively

/*
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
================================================================================
This lesson covers the fundamentals of learning data structures and algorithms effectively.

Key Learning Principles:
1. Start with understanding the problem
2. Think about the approach before coding
3. Practice consistently
4. Learn patterns, not just solutions
5. Build intuition through repetition

Learning Path:
- Master basic data structures (arrays, strings, objects)
- Understand time and space complexity
- Learn common patterns and techniques
- Practice problem-solving systematically
- Build up to more complex structures and algorithms


EXAMPLES:
================================================================================
Learning approach example:
1. Read problem carefully
2. Think of brute force solution
3. Optimize step by step
4. Code the solution
5. Test with examples


CONSTRAINTS:
================================================================================
- Consistency beats intensity
- Practice daily, even if just 15 minutes
- Focus on understanding, not memorization
